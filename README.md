# Climate-stability-Analysis
This project evaluates temperature stability in two potential cities for agricultural investment by calculating the standard deviation of average monthly temperatures. The city with the lower variability in temperature will be deemed more suitable for consistent crop growth and planning.

This dataset includes the following columns:

month: Indicates the month of the year.
Avg Temp City A (°C): The average daily temperature for City A in each month, measured in degrees Celsius.
Avg Temp City B (°C): The average daily temperature for City B in each month, measured in degrees Celsius.
